The locations sensor provides the best location estimate for the usersâ€™ current location, automatically. The location data is provided by [Core Location](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation).

## Requirements
iOS 10 or later.

## Installation

com.aware.ios.sensor.locations is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). 

1. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'com.awareframework.ios.sensor.locations'
```

2. Import com.aware.ios.sensor.locations library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_locations
```

3. Open your project ( *.xcworkspace ) and add `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` and `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` into Info.plist.

## Public functions

### LocationsSensor

+ `init(config:LocationsSensor.Config?)` : Initializes the locations sensor with the optional configuration.
+ `start()`: Starts the locations sensor with the optional configuration.
+ `stop()`: Stops the service.

### LocationsSensor.Config

Class to hold the configuration of the sensor.

#### Fields
+ `sensorObserver: LocationsObserver?` Callback for live data updates. (default = `null`)
+ `frequency: Int` how frequent to check the location, in seconds. By default, every 180 seconds. Setting to 0 (zero) will keep the GPS location tracking always on. (default = 180)
+ `accuracy: Int`  the minimum acceptable accuracy of GPS location, in meters. By default, 150 meters. Setting to 0 (zero) will keep the GPS location tracking always on. (default = 150)
+ `expirationTime: Int64` the amount of elapsed time, in seconds, until the location is considered outdated. By default, 300 seconds. (default = 300)
+ `saveAll: Boolean` Whether to save all the location updates or not. (default = `false`)
+ `enabled: Boolean` Sensor is enabled or not. (default = `false`)
+ `debug: Boolean` enable/disable logging to `Logcat`. (default = `false`)
+ `label: String` Label for the data. (default = "")
+ `deviceId: String` Id of the device that will be associated with the events and the sensor. (default = "")
+ `dbEncryptionKey` Encryption key for the database. (default = `null`)
+ `dbType: Engine` Which db engine to use for saving data. (default = `Engine.DatabaseType.NONE`)
+ `dbPath: String` Path of the database. (default = "aware_locations")
+ `dbHost: String` Host for syncing the database. (default = `null`)

## Broadcasts

### Fired Broadcasts

+ `LocationsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_LOCATIONS` fired when new location available.
+ `LocationsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_GPS_LOCATION_ENABLED` fired when GPS location is active.
+ `LocationsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_GPS_LOCATION_DISABLED` fired when GPS location disabled.

### Received Broadcasts

+ `LocationsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_LOCATIONS_START`: received broadcast to start the sensor.
+ `LocationsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_LOCATIONS_STOP`: received broadcast to stop the sensor.
+ `LocationsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_LOCATIONS_SYNC`: received broadcast to send sync attempt to the host.
+ `LocationsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_LOCATIONS_SET_LABEL`: received broadcast to set the data label. Label is expected in the `LocationsSensor.EXTRA_LABEL` field of the intent extras.

## Data Representations

### Locations Data

Contains the locations profiles.

| Field     | Type   | Description                                                     |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| latitude  | Double | The latitude in degrees.                            |
| longitude | Double | The longitude in degrees.                          |
| course   | Double  | The direction in which the device is traveling, measured in degrees and relative to due north.                            |
| speed     | Float  | The instantaneous speed of the device, measured in meters per second.           |
| altitude  | Double | The altitude, measured in meters.            |
| floor     | Double? | The logical floor of the building in which the user is located. | 
| horizontalAccuracy  | Double  | The radius of uncertainty for the location, measured in meters.  |
| verticalAccuracy    | Double  | The accuracy of the altitude value, measured in meters.     |
| deviceId  | String | AWARE device UUID                                               |
| label     | String | Customizable label. Useful for data calibration or traceability |
| timestamp | Long   | Unixtime milliseconds since 1970                                |
| timezone  | Int    | Rimezone of the device                          |
| os        | String | Operating system of the device (e.g., ios)                    |

## Example usage
```swift
// To initialize the sensor
let locationSensor = LocationsSensor.init(LocationsSensor.Config().apply{config in
    config.sensorObserver = Observer()
    config.debug = true
    config.dbType = DatabaseType.REALM
    // more configuration...
})
// To start the sensor
locationSensor?.start()

// To stop the sensor
locationSensor?.stop()
```

```swift
class Observer:LocationsObserver {
    func onLocationChanged(data: LocationsData) {
    // your code here
    }
}
```
